# MATH285

MATH 285 (Intro to Differential Equations) is a 3 credit hour course that is required for all ECE majors as part of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Core Curriculum. It is offered in the fall, spring, and summer semesters.

## Content Covered

Integrable differential equations
Separable differential equations
Linear ordinary differential equations
Non-linear ordinary differential equations
Basic partial differential equations
Finding general solutions to ODEs
Finding homogeneous and particular solutions to ODEs
Complex numbers
Phasors
Simple matrix mathematics
Laplace Transform
Fourier series
Mechanical harmonic oscillators
Electrical harmonic oscillators

MATH285 is an important course for all engineers as differential equations appear naturally when it comes to describing time-varying systems. The first few lectures of this course are mostly just used to review concepts from Calculus 1 and 2. 

MATH285 then moves on to solving differential equations that are not easily separable or integrable. To do this, there are many mathematical techniques that one will learn to solve certain types of differential equations (i.e. linear, first order, Nth order, etc.). Most of the semester is dedicated to discussing different methods for solving ordinary differential equations and investigating their properties.

Nearing the end of the course, a few introductory partial differential equations, like the heat equation in 1D, are solved using a complex mathematical tool: the Fourier Series.

## Prerequisites

MATH 241

MATH 241 is the only prerequisite for this course. This is a required prerequisite as important fundamental concepts such as partial derivatives and gradients are taught in MATH 241.

## When to Take It

For ECE students, it is a good idea to try and complete MATH 285 as being able to solve differential equations is a necessary skill in early courses like ECE210. 

## Course Structure

MATH285 has a fair workload and is not too conceptually difficult. If you did fine in MATH 241, this class should be relatively easy for you.

Before each lecture, it is suggested to read the assigned chapters in the course textbook so that you can develop a stronger understanding of course material and ask better questions in class.

MATH 285 meets 3 times a week for lecture on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Every other week, the Friday lecture is replaced by an online zoom discussion section where you complete a worksheet on Prairielearn with some other students.

Homework is assigned somewhat irregularly, and has two components. There is a written component which is to be submitted on Canvas, and a Prairielearn component. Being able to solve and understand the homework problems proves to be very useful as exams have a very similar structure and style to the homeworks and practice tests.

MATH285 has three midterms, all held at the CBTF. The final exam is to be taken at home, whilst being proctored on zoom. Calculators are allowed on all exams, and a cheat sheet is also allowed on the final exam.

Note that the course structure of MATH285 often varies slightly from semester to semester. For the most up to date information, view the syllabus or the course website.

## Instructors

Past instructors for this course include Professor Manfroi, Professor Yang, and Professor Bronski. 

## Course Tips

MATH285 is a course that builds important mathematical foundation for engineers of any discipline. It is essential to become accustomed to the methods used in the course to solve differential equations. Try your best to do many practice problems and practice exams so that you can solve problems faster and find patterns that are useful for finding solutions to differential equations.

Many practice exams are posted on Prairielearn as midterms approach. Going through these practice exams is a good idea since the real exams tend to cover very similar structure/problems to that of the practice tests.


## Life After

MATH285 provides essential, fundamental knowledge for many engineers as circuits, mechanical systems, aerodynamics, and electromagnetics are just a few topics that differential equations naturally describe.

Students who really enjoyed MATH285 and are curious to learn more should consider taking MATH 442: Intro to Partial Differential Equations. This course covers partial differential equations and methods to solve them in a very practical context, covering the wave, diffusion, Laplace, and Schrodinger equations for instance.
