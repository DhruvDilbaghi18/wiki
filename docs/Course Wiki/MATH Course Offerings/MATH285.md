MATH285 is an important course for all engineers as differential equations appear naturally when it comes to describing time-varying systems. The first few lectures of this course are mostly just used to review concepts from Calculus 1 and 2. 

MATH285 then moves on to solving differential equations that are not easily separable or integrable. To do this, there are many mathematical techniques that one will learn to solve certain types of differential equations (i.e. linear, first order, Nth order, etc.). Most of the semester is dedicated to discussing different methods for solving ordinary differential equations and investigating their properties.

Nearing the end of the course, a few introductory partial differential equations, like the heat equation in 1D, are solved using a complex mathematical tool: the Fourier Series.

Prerequisites
MATH 241

MATH 241 is the only prerequisite for this course. This is a required prerequisite as important fundamental concepts such as partial derivatives and gradients are taught in MATH 241.

When to Take It
For ECE students, it is a good idea to try and complete MATH 285 as being able to solve differential equations is a necessary skill in early courses like ECE210. 

Course Structure
MATH285 has a fair workload and is not too conceptually difficult. If you did fine in MATH 241, this class should be easy for you.

ECE210 is unusual in that it meets four times a week for lecture. Lecture attendance is not required but is recorded using iClickers, with students who attend at least 76% of lectures being allowed to retake quizzes. Some topics may require more than one lecture, sometimes even three, to fully cover one section of the chapter. Don’t be fooled, this class moves at a fast pace consistently, and requires you to have a strong comfort level with material every day. It can be easy to fall behind if you stop attending lectures.

Homework is assigned weekly. Homework assignments take up a decent amount of time, and usually cover the material of the current week and the week prior. Since this class builds on from each chapter to the next, understanding how to do the homework problems is your key to success. Note that each chapter contains many examples that are comparable to homework problems. Making an effort to fully understand the concepts behind every problem will shorten the amount of time required to prepare for quizzes and exams.

ECE210 also has three quizzes, held at the CBTF in between midterm exams. To prepare for these quizzes, students are recommended to go over past homework problems.

In addition to the homeworks and quizzes, ECE210 also has three midterm exams and a final exam. These exams, especially the second and third midterms and the final exam, are challenging and typically have low average scores. Exams reflect material covered in homework, but most likely will contain 1 or 2 tricky problems that test the student's ability to apply concepts to unfamiliar situations. Students are not allowed a calculator or cheat sheet and are only provided with specific tables from the textbook. Thus, doing well on the exams will require an excellent understanding of the relevant concepts. Practicing past exam problems and the homeworks will help one perform well on exams, as will reading the textbook.

Finally, ECE210 also has a lab component, focusing on the real-world applications of concepts covered in lecture, of which there are many. Lab meetings are biweekly and do not begin until one month into the semester. One week before the lab section meets for demos, a short prelab assignment is due. The prelab assignments are not too difficult and are meant to review necessary concepts from lecture for the upcoming lab. There are a total of five lab assignments in ECE210. For each lab assignment, students will fill out a worksheet. The worksheets require the student to build circuits, take measurements of their circuits using the ADALM-2000 and Scopy software, including measuring frequency response and Fourier coefficients, and plot signals in the time and frequency domains. During the lab section, students are expected to demo their circuit to the TAs or CAs and answer one to two questions regarding the relevant concepts. Much of the lab covers the application of signal processing to AM radio. In the labs, students will construct an envelope detector, amplifier circuits, and an active filter before combining them to build a work AM radio receiver. The final lab covers sampling of continuous time signals, requiring the use of Python.

An additional weekly honors section led by upperclassmen is also available to students who want to use Python for course relevant material. The honors section consists of a weekly one hour tutorial/demo section where students are taught about Python concepts related to signal processing. The student must then complete a Jupyter Notebook assignment that can take two to five hours, depending on the week. Completing the six Python assignments will earn a James Scholar student honors credit. The honors section is a good way to learn introductory Python skills, and is very helpful if students intend to take ECE311 or ECE314, the accompanying labs for ECE310 and ECE313, respectively.

Note that the course structure of ECE210 often varies slightly from semester to semester. For the most up to date information, view the syllabus or the course website.

Instructors
This course is currently directed by Professor Kudeki. Instructors vary from semester to semester and typically have backgrounds in a wide variety of fields of electrical engineering, namely signal processing, communications, electromagnetics, power systems, and solid-state electronics. Professors who have taught ECE210 recently include Professors Alvarez, Schmitz, Waldrop, Lee, Mironov, Mironenko, Chen, Schuh, Shao, and He. Professor Alvarez has taught this course every semester since Fall 2019.

Course Tips
ECE210 is a challenging course. Do not skip lectures, as this will only require you to spend more time later to catch up on the material. Falling behind can make it much more difficult to do well in the class. While in lecture, take good notes and ask good questions. Consistency is key for this class. Being consistent with asking questions to your professors, reading up on the material, taking notes, whatever helps you learn best - as long as you are consistent, you can succeed in this course!

Now is the time to form good study habits. Start homework early. If you get stuck, consult your notes and the textbook, and go to office hours. Even if you feel like you understand the content, going to office hours is still a good idea, as other students may ask questions you haven’t considered before. In addition to lectures, read the textbook often. This will allow you to pick up on topics you may have missed during lecture. The textbook also contains many practice problems that are similar to the homework problems, which can help you gain a deeper understanding of the material.

Many past exams are posted on the course website, dating back to 2007. Going through the past exam problems is one of the best ways to study for the midterm and final exams. However, simply looking over the solutions for past exams will not help at all. Past exams are truly useful if they are taken in an exam environment (and if you only check solutions after truly attempting the problem).

The professors have started to run small discussion sections on Thursdays and Fridays that you have to sign up for in advance, with the groups being limited in size. During these sessions, you will work on extra problems and walk through them with the professors or TA's. These discussion sections are the most useful resources available. Sign up for these, especially if you are struggling in the course!

Life After
ECE210 is the foundation of the electrical engineering curriculum and is the prerequisite to many intermediate and advanced level ECE courses. Electrical engineering majors are recommended to take ECE329 - Fields and Waves I the semester after taking ECE210 as it is a required course for EEs and the next step in the EE Core Curriculum. ECE329 is the introductory course in electromagnetics, covering important, fundamental topics such as Maxwell’s equations, wave propagation, transmission lines, and impedance matching. ECE329 requires a good understanding of phasors and lumped circuit analysis from ECE210.

Students who enjoyed the signal processing portion of ECE210 should consider ECE310 - Digital Signal Processing. While ECE210 focuses on continuous-time signal processing, ECE310 focuses on discrete-time signal processing. Many of the topics covered in ECE210, including linearity, causality, stability, convolution, and Fourier transforms, will also be covered in ECE310, but in the digital domain. Sampling and reconstruction of analog signals will also be covered in much more detail in ECE310.

For students who enjoyed the signal processing portion and wish to pursue signal processing further, it is also recommended to take ECE313 - Probability with Engineering Applications the semester after taking ECE210. ECE313 is another mathematically heavy course that is required for all ECE majors, covering probability theory. ECE210 and ECE313 will prepare students for advanced courses in the field of signal processing and communications systems, including ECE459 - Communications Systems and ECE461 - Digital Communications. ECE459 and ECE461 expand upon many concepts taught in ECE210, including Fourier transforms, convolution, amplitude modulation, bandwidth, and linear time-invariant systems. ECE459 largely covers analog modulation schemes as well as some digital modulation techniques and topics related to probability, namely, random processes and signal to noise ratio. ECE461 largely covers modeling of digital communications systems, discussing the communication of bits over additive Gaussian noise, wireline, and wireless channels.

Students who enjoyed the circuit analysis portion of ECE210 should consider ECE342 - Electronic Circuits. ECE342 covers circuit analysis and design with nonlinear components - diodes, MOSFETs, and BJTs - and largely focuses on amplifiers. In this course, among other topics, students will learn to graph Bode plots and estimate transfer functions of amplifiers, building off of concepts introduced in ECE210.

Students who enjoyed the circuit analysis portion of ECE210 should also consider ECE330 - Power Circuits and Electromechanics. ECE330 covers circuits relevant to the power field, relying on a student’s knowledge of phasors, RMS values, and complex numbers. In ECE330, students will learn three-phase circuit analysis, wye and delta connections, the wye-delta transform, and the equivalent circuits of transformers, synchronous machines, and induction machines. An understanding of the stability of systems will also be relevant for ECE330.

Along with PHYS214 and credit or concurrent registration in ECE329, ECE210 is a prerequisite for ECE340 - Semiconductor Devices, a required course for electrical engineering majors. Though ECE340 has little overlap with ECE210 itself, focusing more on the physics of semiconductor materials and devices, students who liked their prior physics courses, especially PHYS213 and PHYS214, could consider specializing in solid-state electronics and taking ECE329 and ECE340 concurrently the following semester.

Finally, ECE210 is also a prerequisite for ECE486 - Control Systems. Controls is a field closely related to signal processing and has to do with the regulation of systems to ensure desired behavior using feedback. ECE486 is the introductory course in controls, using many topics introduced in ECE210 such as system stability and the Laplace transform and applying them to feedback control systems.

Students should develop a better idea of their academic interests after taking this course. Generally, students who dislike this class do not intend to pursue electrical engineering as a major. However, be aware that ECE210 is only the tip of the iceberg of electrical engineering, and not liking this course does not necessarily indicate disinterest. This course will give the electrical engineering student a better idea on what to specialize in, as well as aid in the choice of technical electives (especially those in the 3-of-5 for EE majors and the 1-of-6 for CompE majors).

Infamous Topics
Fourier series, Fourier transform: This is among the most difficult and math-heavy topics in the course, though it is also the most applicable. For this reason, it is highly recommended for students to study this fully to be prepared for future electrical engineering courses.
Convolution: Performing convolutions using the integral method can be computationally difficult. Students should be familiar with graphical convolution and should use this method whenever possible.
Laplace transform: Along with the Fourier transform, the Laplace transform is a concept that requires an excellent understanding of foundational mathematics, especially differential equations.
Resources
The textbook for ECE210, Analog Signals and Systems, is co-authored by the course director, Professor Kudeki. It is an excellent supplement to lectures and provides many practice problems which can be helpful for studying for quizzes and exams.
